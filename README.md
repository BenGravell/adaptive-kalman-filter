# adaptive_kalman_filter

The code in this repository implements the adaptive Kalman filter for systems with unknown process and measurement noise covariance.

The filter is based on the work in "Adaptive Kalman Filter for Detectable Linear Time-Invariant Systems" by Moghe, Zanetti and Akella at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/full/10.2514/1.G004359.
